# Collection Stubs

This is intended to hold stubs for various collection classes. This repository 
gathers in one convenient place various GitHub Gists I've created over the years 
of my Java experience.

It is organized thus:

* Immutable collections
  * Immutable lists
    * Array-backed lists
    * Linked lists
      * Singly-linked
      * Doubly-linked
  * Immutable maps
  * Immutable sets
* Mutable collections
  * Caches (these can only be mutable, right?)
  * Mutable lists
      * Array-backed lists
      * Linked lists
          * Singly-linked
          * Doubly-linked
  * Mutable maps
  * Mutable sets

I will probably add more.
